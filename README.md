# mrbreader


This is `mrbreader` - a small Python package to enable convenient reading and parsing of
compound `MRB` files (**M**edical **R**eality **B**undle) that are usually produced
by the [3DSlicer](https://www.slicer.org/) software.

The 3DSlicer is often used to perform a manual semantic image segmentation
for medical data (i.e. CT or MRI).
The `mrbreader` can be used to extract and modify the produced segmentation
data from the medical reality bundle.
